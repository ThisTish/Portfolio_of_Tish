		"description":"Our gaming tutorial hub is a comprehensive platform designed to provide gamers with an easy way to find and create guides across all games and platforms. By integrating the IGDB API and utilizing GraphQL, the application allows users to search for tutorials, share their own, and engage with a community of players. It solves the problem of fragmented resources for gaming tutorials by consolidating everything into one interactive and user-friendly hub. Whether you're looking for beginner tips or advanced strategies, our platform makes it simple to access and contribute valuable gaming content. \n \nAs the project manager, I was responsible for overseeing the development process, ensuring that we stayed on track with deadlines, and distributing tasks efficiently among the team. I assisted with debugging, supported the team in resolving technical issues, and provided guidance when challenges arose. I also ensured the seamless integration of both front-end and back-end components to deliver a high-quality, interactive user experience."
